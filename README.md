# EWSMT - Enty`s Windows Server Managment Tool<br>

## This is a small batch script that gives you a few selectable options to save you work when it comes to annoying things like releasing ports for your FiveM server.<br>

selectable options:
-> Stop http = frees port 80<br>
-> Open/Close FxServer Ports = Opens/Closes 30120 FiveM Standard Port (In/Out UDP/TCP)<br>
-> Taskkill FxServer Instance = Sometimes when you Stop the FxServer.exe there is a Ghost Instance running that stopps you from Updating your Server<br>
-> More soon...<br>
